 * Attack Description:
    Even some of the logic in benign smartApps could be misused to do something dangerous as long as the attacker stole the Oauth token.



Malicous VacationMode:
    Normal functions:
    The vacation mode smartApp could detect whether there is anybody home. If there is  nobody home and the user turn on the switch of the vacation mode, then the smartApp could control the light to simulate occupancy. When the sunrise, it would turn on the light. While the sunset, it would turn off the light.

    Malicious functions:
    Attacker with the legitimate token could control the vacation mode. If the user is out of home and has set on the vacation mode to let the light open when sunset. The user could send a put request to the smartAppâ€™s path to trigger it set off the vacation mode.
