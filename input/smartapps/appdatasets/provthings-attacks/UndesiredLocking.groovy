/**
 * Attack Description:
 * 		 The misuse of the benign smartApp logic would also cause some potential dangers. Undesired
 * 		 unlocking is a pretty typical one among these attacks.
 * 
 * Normal functions:
 * 		The existence of presenceSensor could automatically unlock the door. If the user get away for
 * 		ten minutes, then it would lock the door. While the user comes back, it would control the door
 * 		to open automatically.
 * 
 * 
 * Malicious functions:
 * 		The malicious smartApp has such a vulnerabilities. If the range of the presenceSensor is wide
 * 		enough, then there would lead to the result that not only the targeted door has been opened. 
 * 		The other door that has detected the existence of the presenceSensor would be unlocked which
 * 		is agianst the userâ€™s will and lead to great danger.
